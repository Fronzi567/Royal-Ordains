1,"White, the purest of all colours, the most radiant. The very symbol of purity manifests in the spectrum of physical aspects. In truth, such an uncorrupted is also the easiest to be tainted."
2,"Red is often regarded as a symbol of honour and battle, for it is the place where blood is drawn in earnest with passions unmatched even by the greatest of love. Many also believe it to be the opposite of white, for only in war can purity not coexist even in duplicity."
3,"Blue, the gentleness and ferocity in the very same existence. When one thinks of blue, the water body is the first to come to mind. The ever-changing nature of such existence reflects well in this peculiar hue that influences the perceiver's sovereign soul in abundance."
4,"Yellow, the association with that of golden makes it represent value for many. And indeed, such a value conjures envy, greed, and unfounded pride, all from those who possess much to possess not. An abstract object of worship, yet all the same as many other such idols."
5,"Purple, its supposed rareness in the natural world causes many in power and wealth to associate it in themselves. The regality of such a subject is not for debate as much as the prohibition for lower society to even possess or dye it on their possessions."
6,"Green, the central balance of the Chromatism Circular Principle that represents modesty among the extremes. Indeed, such a colour provokes calmness like often encountered in abundance when one glances at the vert nature."
7,"Black, or perhaps the void of colour as some theorised, is the basis of summation for all beings, for the void is beginning in all things. Many also associate it with unknowns and corruption, for only in blackness they can look but know not what they see."
8,"Orange or yellow-red, as often termed, represent an abundance for passion and wealth in correct combinations oftentimes leading to such a phenomenon."
9,"Grey, with its representative silver, symbolises humility in all things in contrast to gold. A wisdom that can only be attained with understanding in life."

11,"There was once a warm, gentle, and caring God in the better times or perhaps the better place. Much has changed since. And the visage of such is no more than a fantasy of those who come after."
12,"The blood of my enemy quench my thirst but not my hunger. The revenges of my past fill my heart but not my life."
13,"It is impossible for anyone to accomplish everything alone, and not everyone can finish what they start. The leader may be able to create one from zero, but it takes his followers to make the one expands"
14,"When the light under the heaven shines brightly, it will blot the light from above and so gone the sight of the unreached paradise."
15,"The greatest of arts are not the ones that are the most popular at the time but the ones that charm the viewer's mind for eternity."
16,"Even the blightest sun can be blocked by the closer moon."
17,"The work of craft is not about what you can do. It is all about what you want to do."
18,"Destiny, the guidance of a higher being to those lower. One can do nought but answer the call. No matter whether they are aware or unaware of it."
19,"An eternal ruler is a dream that once was and ever will be. For utopia can only be everlasting when its ruler never changes nor compromises."
20,"What is madness? Is it the realisation of the absurdity of the world? Or is it the ignorance of the absurdity of one own mind?"
21,"Death. An end of both bad and good alike. It is preordained that life can not exist indefinitely. For decay must take hold before the state of stagnation inaugurates and expands."
22,"The lower world can not directly influence its higher, such is the Law of Order mandated by Gods."
23,"The High Race theory is not a just thought, concept, or even theory for some. Rather, it is a belief they hold firmly in their heart that their bearings are directly disseminated from their forebears and they are destined for greatness."
24,"It is said art is a medium to converse with Gods. This is why the role of the artist commonly fell to those in religious practices in the early days. For the highest master crafts can only be produced with dedication to the creator's most elevated of worship."
25,"I love the world, and the world loves me back. I know this because I am happy."
26,"Trust only leads to the death of conscience. When you become so trustful of something it will blind you and bind you to the depth of abyss where you can no longer even notice that you are blind."
27,"If the ruler can not control the followers without having to command them, then he is no true ruler, for the ruler is the very embodiment of his devotees."
28,"The political arena is not dissimilar to chess boards. The pieces on one side are the entirety of the whole country. But what is the hand that moves the pieces? The answer is simple; the hand is the collective will of the state. Without the pieces, the hand can not move the country forward, and the movement can not be formed without the hand to guide it. But one question remains, can there be other winning goals besides crushing the enemy factions entirely?"
29,"There is no such thing as artificial matter. When all we can ever do is create something out of nature."
30,"The weight of knowledge is worth the civilisation of life, for only history can be remembered by the living, and only the dead can discard the burden of memory."
31,"The face of the matter is that we are bound to the tyranny of life. We all are forced to come into the world kicking and screaming then we will be forced to perish whether we want to or not. Throughout our lives, we must obey the rules of nature just to exist. We must consume because the law of energy dictates it. Some may say we have the free will to choose when or how we die, but that is simply an illusion of free will. In the end, we simply choose to obey the inevitable sooner."
32,"The matter of warfare is simply an extension of politics. War does not exist because diplomacy fails but because we long for it. Why else would we go against the teaching of gods to obey the word of another mortal?"
33,"Know no good, and you will never see evil. For ignorance is the first state of the mind."
34,"Assuming that life truly has some form of meaning, and we exist to serve some purposes designated by our creator or god. This theory entails that death, the end of life, must also have meaning. And this would imply that death can only occur if our purpose is achieved."
35,"What does happiness truly mean when it can not be achieved from the suffering of others?"
36,"I do not fear that paradise may not exist. What I fear the most is that it exists, but none of us are worthy of it."
37,"It is impossible for anyone to accomplish everything alone, and not everyone can finish what they start. The leader may be able to create one from zero, but it takes his followers to make the one expand."
38,"My world is rather limited even though the land is vast."
39,"The end does not justify the mean unless the end becomes the only that all can see."
40,"Despair not for the end but rejoice for the new beginning."
