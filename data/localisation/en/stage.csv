1,1,1,"The first of the Royal Ordains' journey started at the outskirsts of the Pamat Forest, home to a variety of uncountable bushes, beasts, and wrongdoers. Here. a Rabbitman tribe had been terrorising the good and honest people of Masendor for many winters. By the order of the wisest and greatest king, the heroes embarked to exterminate all threats, with force if need be."
1,1,2,"Rabbitmen are among the most common beastmen inhabit throughout the world. Similar to many other minor civilised races, they are capable of learning, simple verbal communication, conductting religious activity and warfare."
1,1,3,"Rabbitmen typically lived in tribal communes. They are generally a coward band will fight only when they have an advantage or are in danger. They are crude, rude, and exclude of any civilised decorum."
1,1,4,"In the Pamat Forest alone, the number of Rabbitmen accounts for around a thousand due to their rapid breeding, similar to their rabbit cousins. They make up one big tribe after a series of conquests left unchecked for a decennium due to the previous crisis."
1,2,1,"With the raiding formation of the Rabbitman tribe perished two morns ago, the Royal Ordains' great deeds were obvious to all who inhabit in Pamat Forest. The rabbitmen, with their allies; vicious snails, and keensight eagles, dispatched their largest force with the sole intention of annihilating the heroes."
1,2,2,"The alliance was formed to wrestle control of the forest outskirts from a group of armed humanoid bandits. As the forest is between the border of the unfriendly Elven Kingdom, it becomes the perfect place for savage factions to grow unhindered."
1,2,3,"Snails are mysterious creatures, tall from a mere finger to an adult dwarf. They are capable of wielding simple weapons and only good at defensive combat. Many believe that the big shell is the snail's home. Some snails live long enough to become wise but bitter and often throw their beard at those who annoy them."
1,2,4,"The eagles were naturally enemy of the rabbitmen but saw that their home was invaded by other races. They temporarily aided the rabbitmen against the more dangerous threats. Their superior sky movement and claw's strength allow for a swift transport and ambush tactic for the troops."
1,2,5,"The alliance was indeed a fickle one. While the rabbitmen may appear to be the leader, they are more like the grunt ones who did the most works and fighting. Still, despite their small of stature, they are relatively hard-working warriors. An army of rabbitmen may well be the future of warfare where physical might become less needed."
1,2,6,"This illustration depicts the celebration or possibly ritual that the rabbitmen typically hosted either by themselves or for the alliance roughly every week. Eyewitnesses describe the event as hectic, with rabbitmen singing and dancing around after a grand feast."
1,3,1,"A week passed since the great victory of the last battle. As per the rule of the alliance, those who prove their strength and valour can challenge the champion and become the leader. The brave heroes of Royal Ordains naturally accepted the invitation and approached the arena with anticipation."
1,3,2,"Warren mound is a common type of dwelling for rabbitmen. These mounds are about as tall as a story house and consist of connected tunnel entrances. Sometimes created from an artificially made mound, these tiny labyrinths serve as immaculate protection against invaders."
1,3,3,"The Royal Ordains faced the leaders of the forest kin alliance, Bigta the Dog and Setors the Rabbit. The undefeated champion of probably around ten battles. The rabbit was quick on his feet, and the dog was accurate in her spear thrust. Making them the mightiest of cavalry in the forest."
1,3,4,"The greatest and only jousting arena existed in the Pamat Forest. Built by the Rabbitman tribe roughly ten years ago before this recorded battle, likely an imitation of the Aneosel Jousting Field at Epsla Na Polad City. Any who can prove to be the strongest here becomes the tribe leader."
