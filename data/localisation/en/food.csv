"ID","Name","Description","Meal Ingredients","Tag"
1,"Death itself","The saying, either brave or stupid does not apply here. There is no bravery in eating this meal, only stupidity. You will literally die after the first bite. Sure, you may be revived afterwards as part of the service, but the aftereffect will leave you infirm like a coma patient awaiting death's visit once more.",,"Bad"
2,"Deadly Poison Stew","Unlike the infamous Felkulosian deadly cuisine, this stew tastes so bad you may survive eating it from all the puking. But if you manage to swallow it, be prepared to suffer excruciating pain that will make most with low willpower commit suicide before dying from the poison itself.","Devil Mushroom, Shadowshade, Wolfsbanes, Lamentation’s Paratoid Glands","Bad"
3,"Literal Dungs","You are about to eat literal shites from various animals and sources. It is uncertain why the tavern serves such things, but it is obvious now why a private room exists for the heroes to feast. If the people manage to catch sight of this feast, they will surely lose faith.",,"Bad"
4,"Beggar and Hobo’s Delight","The name Delight is a joke. It should be Sorrow. No one should feel happy consuming this meal of pure sadness, except for maybe flies and maggots that you are about to eat as well.","Rotten Egg, Moldy Beard","Bad"
5,"Chef’s Mishaps","Alright, this meal was not created by us. We did not make any mistakes. And you heroes are not about eating the meal prepared by us. It was made by the Swelling Pig Inn on the other side of the city, and we managed to secure it from them... somehow. It definitely tastes bad because it is not our food.","Ingredients Unknown (The Swelling Pig Inn Made It)","Bad"
6,"Smelly Pungent Disgusting Roll","This roll is filled with ingredients decreed as illegal within the Empire. So your ordering this meal can be trialled in court. Only the stupidest of connoisseurs can appreciate this work of art. Do not forget to take a bath after the meal.","Illegal Maggot Epoisses, Illegal Fermented Herring (Yes it is Surströmming), Beans, Cabbages, A Hint of Chamomile (undetectable)","Bad"
7,"Storage Leftover Meal","As often said, only naughty children waste food. This is the meal you definitely should pray to the One God before partaking. It will be a miracle if you manage to survive without some loose stool incidents afterwards.","Unrecognisable Vegetables and Meats, Perhaps a Drowned Rat's Corpse","Bad"
8,"Plain Water","Just plain drinkable water. You wonder why even bother paying for this.","Silence Cups of Water","Good"
9,"Beer","You want to forget dark days, you drink beer. You want to cheer for your meagre life, you drink beer. You want to rest from back-breaking labour all day, you drink beer. You are a pompous blue blooded noble, you drink wine.","Rowdy Mugs Filled With Piss-Like Hops Beer","Good"
10,"Adventurer Meal","Meal that will last for months if kept well. It tastes like the void itself and will definitely make you regret becoming an adventurer.","Dried Meat, Dry Bread, Dry Nuts","Good"
11,"Peasant Breakfast","A light meal that provides enough nutrition to go on another laborious day.","Dark Rye Bread, Cheese, Nuts","Good"
12,"Pub Hearty Meal","A hearty meal ","Ale","Good"
13,"Out-of-Festival Meal","A lavish meal that usually made for festival.",,"Good"
14,"Hunting Game Meal",,"Venison, Hear Meat, Stuffed Boar Head","Good"
15,"Exotic Fruit Basket","This basket of exotic fruits actually worth more than a week of skilled workers.",,"Good"
16,"Hero’s Feast","This meal menu is reserved only for you, the hero of the people.","Hydra Tongue, Reaper Chilli, Royal Honey","Good"
17,"Deadly Cuisine","A genius mind from Felkulos discovered that the deadly poisonous tongue of Hydra actually tastes... shall we say, heavenly enough to die for. So what can you do to partake in this meal and survive after? Have a healing mage nearby to heal and cure you of the toxin at the same time. Are you ready to ascend to heaven of cuisine regardless?",,"Good"
18,"Unicorn Steak","The purest form of food is only possible from the purest of creatures. The grated unicorn horn over a chunk of entrecôte cut surely makes this meal the cure-all elixir itself. Or so you believe.","Unicorn entrecôte, Unicorn Horn, Black Pepper, Salt, Cinnamon, Rosemary, Thyme, Red Wine, Fake Decorating Horn","Good"
19,"King’s Feast","You wonder how a commoner's tavern manages to secure such luxurious ingredients for this meal. That is until the aroma disrupts your brain function, and only the foods in front of you remain in your mind.","Roast Duck, ","Good"
20,"Ambrosia","You are not sure if you should consume this meal. The divinity aura alone compels you to revere it as if the One God himself or whoever you worship is looking at you in the eyes.","You probably should investigate who makes this meal","Good"
