"King/Yuawies/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Say, do you think we can hold one now?"
"King/Yuawies/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","Not yet. We will hold one after your first victory."

"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","You are to go along with their quest and assist them."
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","See that they become true heroes worthy of our hope."
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","My king, I beg your pardon. I am in a conflicted mind."
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Is my participant in this necessary?"
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","My Aide, your strength is proven to me."
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.7","But I deem that this will be a great opportunity for you."
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.8","I ask of you again, be their companion in difficult times."
"King/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.9","Yes, my King. As you wish. I will do my utmost."

"Nayedien/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","… (Hmm, trouble abounds?)"
"Nayedien/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Simply advise that a hero is not excused for crimes."
"Nayedien/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","I know, and talk no more of it. (Guess not.)"
"Nayedien/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Good. Now trouble me no more. I have a duty to attend."
"Nayedien/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","As you should. (Best withdraw for now.)"
"Nayedien/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","I FEEL YOUR STRENGTH. WHY HIDE IT?"
"Nayedien/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Why do you questioning everyone about their strength?"
"Nayedien/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","STRONG ONE CAN HELP MY TRAINING. WILL YOU?"
"Nayedien/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","Well, I am too occupied with all this organising."

"Nayedien/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Forgive my rudeness. I just never met an elf before."
"Nayedien/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","I understand you bear no ill will. No offence taken."
"Nayedien/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","But do be mindful that others may not take it well."
"Nayedien/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","Thank you for your advise. I will be more careful."
"Nayedien/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","I heard you are an old friend of the king."
"Nayedien/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Indeed, I am. Helped each other to survive a troll."
"Nayedien/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","What about you, hmm?"
"Nayedien/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","Not as long as you, sadly. Only ten winters ago."
"Nayedien/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Would you kindly spare time recounting his tale anon?"
"Nayedien/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","Yes, my dear. Whenever our schedules allow it."

"Nayedien/Duskuksa/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","I thought your kind are too conceited for this."
"Nayedien/Duskuksa/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Mayhap for others. I never believed in such superiority."
"Nayedien/Duskuksa/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","I beheld his character, and I offer boundless admiration."
"Nayedien/Duskuksa/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","I can see there is something in his royal highness."
"Nayedien/Duskuksa/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","Conceivably, one day, I can comprehend in full as well."
"Nayedien/Laguasangte/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1",
"Nayedien/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.1","I suggest you take a rest and prepare for your journey."

"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","I implore you to take no offence in what I will state."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","To be direct, you surely have talents waiting to grow"
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","but you still need more experience and grow stronger."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","For that, although many crises await to be solved"
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","We will assign you the quests proper to your strengths."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.7","So, talk to me again when you are ready to start."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.1","Are you ready to start your journey?"
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes1","Very good. Your first destination is Panac Forest."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes2","The incursions in the northern region stem from there."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes3","You will start from the outer forest against Rabbitmen."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes4","They are weak, but their number grows alarmingly fast."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes5","Deal with the leader and disrupt the expansion."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes6","We left you the choice of subjugation or elimination."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes7","Subjugation, you may convert them as followers."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes8","Elimination, you can take what they hold."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.yes9","Your escorts will leave at dawn. For now, rest well."
"Vurus/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.no1","Take your time to prepare and inform me when ready."
"Hermanos/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","To be truthful, we nobles should not waste time with lowborns."
"Hermanos/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Still, I am in a kind mood, so I will extend my noblesse oblige."
"Hermanos/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Everytime you succeed your mission, I will spare knowledge."
"Hermanos/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","Something you should learn or maybe should not of our land."
"Hermanos/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Talk to me after you show usefulness and graced with learning."
"Hermanos/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","Well, well, a female warrior, eh? Not a common sight at all."
"Hermanos/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Are you perhaps one of the potential saints?"
"Hermanos/Vraesier/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Silly ol' me, I doubt they want rugged lass like you."
"Hermanos/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","Salute, big man. Your stature is inspiring in strength."
"Hermanos/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Alas, I myself am not blessed with martial potential. "
"Hermanos/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","With one like you in every rank, our army will be invincible!"
"Hermanos/Orsanoas/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","But, of course, war is still won by a steadfast noble mind."
"Hermanos/Minara/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1",
"Hermanos/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","A lord from another land as our hero? Salutation to you!"
"Hermanos/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Where do you hail from, foreign lord?"
"Hermanos/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Greetings, I am from Garbarra city-state, Far west from here."
"Hermanos/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","As a faraway lord, I am sure you wish to learn of our court."
"Hermanos/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Approach me at any time if you require, I will be of service."
"Hermanos/Laguasangte/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1",
"Hermanos/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","Good day. I heard you are in the trade of adventuring."
"Hermanos/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Correct! I have ventured far and wide across this continent."
"Hermanos/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","Good, trade of information I am in and a lucrative offer I have."
"Hermanos/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","A fine exchange will do good for both of us, do you not agree?"
"Hermanos/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Agree. A local information for foreign ones we will exchange."
"Hermanos/Iri/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","Fantastic, talk to me again later."

"Hermanos/Duskuksa/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","I may be shorter than many, but I am still a high-born human."
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.1","Salutation, a memoriable day today for land's history."
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.2","Heroes come to rescue us from all the crises. Excitement!"
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.3","I do not witness any truthfulness in your talk."
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.4","Should I consider that as subordination to our King?"
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.5","Oh no! Not at all. I do think that more help is always welcome."
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.6","Just that this hero group of ours still need to prove their worth."
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.7","Understandable, no one deserves respect they do not earn."
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.8","Hear hear! Now, just for you, any court rumour I gather"
"Hermanos/Nayedien/1_1_city_throne_talk1.9","you will hear it from me first. I will always be here!"

"Hermanos/Any/1_1_city_throne_talk2.1","Nothing new yet. Talk to me after finishing your quest."
"Vraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.1","GOOD DAY, WARRIOR. I NEED YOUR HELP."
"Vraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.2","What?"
"Vraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.3","SPARRING WITH ME, LET BECOME STRONGER."
"Vraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.4","Hmm. If my sister approves, then yes."
"Vraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.1","Talk to my sister."
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.1","I have a query, miss, that may be rude to ask."
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.2","Ask."
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.3","Why were you two sisters involved in banditry?"
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.4","Such activities are rather uncommon for the fairer sex."
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.5","Necessity."
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.6","I see this land is also rife in iniquity. "
"Vraesier/Rodhinbar/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.7","I do hope one day, we achieve true peace in this world."

"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.1","Sister, do not forget our mission. It would be a disgrace"
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.2","if we fail because you are fordrunken from morn to night."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.3","Well, you should relax some yourself, little sis."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.4","We did not have much chance to feast out in the forest."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.5","Also, that so called great king did promise us with help."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.6","Much easier to find her than before clueless, I am sure."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.7","While you are out on your little journey, I will resume."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.8","You better. I only come here because you pestered me."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.9","I will only stay if you and they can produce results."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.10","I hear you loud and clear, my little impatient sister."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.1","By the way, your little quarrel with that Aide."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.2","I know you hate the blue blood, but keep it down a touch."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.3","It is not wise to create resentment with our benefactors."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.4","Rest assured, sister. There is no real hatred between us."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.5","Something tells me that Aide is of common origin."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.6","We will get along just fine, you will see."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.7","Is it now? I trust your assessment then."
"Nraesier/Vraesier/1_1_city_tavern_talk3.1","Go have some fun, will you?"
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.1","I heard you sisters are very strong."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.2","I also heard you are pretty strong yourself, big man."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.3","Not enough, can you both be my training partners?"
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.4","Hmm, my sister should be of more help in that regard."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.5","She can help in spare time, but not for free, of course."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.6","What do you require in exchange?"
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.7","An experiment and oath of secrecy."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.8","No worry. It will not involve harming you or others."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.9","I think I can agree to that, after you disclose more detail."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.10","Sure thing, let discuss thing out later."
"Nraesier/Orsanoas/1_1_city_tavern_talk2.1","Talk to you again later, big man."
"Nraesier/Nayedien/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.1","Greeting, take a liking to my sister, eh?"
"Nraesier/Nayedien/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.2","Absurd of you to think so. You, I can tolerate."
"Nraesier/Nayedien/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.3","But your sister, she ought to learn manners."
"Nraesier/Nayedien/1_1_city_tavern_talk1.4","Outstanding opportunity, that is. Please, be her teacher."

,"Our faith originates from the City of Valle. Far East from here."
