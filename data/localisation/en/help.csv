"Vraesier1","Vagrant Marauder",,"Complexity: Low","A warrior hero with balanced melee attack moves for all positions. Her special ability is demonic blood. She gains resources mainly from dealing damage to enemies. Nearby enemies affecting bleeding status also regenerate her resources. Once the resources bar is full, she can enter an awakened state (using the Special button), which unlocks powerful special attack moves with a greatsword.","Most of her skills can either deal significant damages or inflict debuff statuses on enemies. Most of the attacking skills do not cost resources and have a very low cooldown. Hence, they can be used interchangeably with normal attack moves.",
"Iri1","Traveller",,"Complexity: High","A hero specialises in trap setup skills. Most of her attack moves are very simple and inferior to other heroes. The player has to rely on trap skills to deal real damage.","Aside from triggering from the enemy collision, most of the trap skills have duration before automatically triggering by itself (around 10 seconds). It is also possible to set a trap at point-blank range of the enemy to make it activate right away. Once triggered, the traps will also drop an item that the player can pick up to regain back some of the resources. Another aspect of this hero is that her speed will change depending on her remaining resources, with higher resources equating to a higher reduction in speed.",
"Duskuksa1","Rune Sage Apprentice",,"Complexity: Low","Dwarf rune sage who specialises in applying a powerful supporting buff to himself and nearby allies. Equipped with a pair of an axe and a hammer, this stout heart man is capable of unleashing a good amount of damage in melee combat.","Most of his skills exist to provide a variety of positive status effects, making him one of the most valuable allies to have for a large party group. One downside of his skills is that they usually cost a large amount of resources or have very high cooldown, so they can not be used in abundance. Good planning will do well to make him most effective in combat.",
"Nayedien1","King’s Aide",,"Complexity: Medium","Elvish Arcane warrior with extremely strong melee attacks. Each weak attack will escalate the combat stance, unlocking a higher-level set of strong attacks.","Once in a combat state, the player will have a few seconds to attack before losing the stance level. Most moves require resources to perform, and there are no attack moves for couch or air position.","The skills can only be performed after its appropriate stance is active. Most skills are extremely powerful and have no cooldown, but usually cost large amounts of resources. This character can also use health to perform moves after resources run out."
"Rodhinbar1","Headman",,"Complexity: Low","An archer with versatile sets of skills to unleash death from safety range. Capable of performing long-range attacks with the cost of resources. His melee attacks are somewhat lacking compared to other heroes but not entirely unhelpful. They can be used to remove weaker foes to preserve resources for stronger ones.","His bow shooting attack can be charged (by holding the attack button) before loosing the arrow to increase damage output. A moderately complex character to play. While his attacks and skills are easy to use, they require constant resource management to stay combat-effective.",
