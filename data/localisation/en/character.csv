"Vraesier","Vagrant Marauder","This bandit has one thing really going, and that is her skill in weapons of most varieties.

"Minara","Exiled Scout",,"Archer"
"Rodhinbar","Headman","A chief of a distant land with unmatched skill in archery. He seemed to arrive with a heavy conflict in his heart after receiving the invitation from the King to join the Royal Ordains.

"Iri","Traveller","No one really understands why this hearty halfling travelled so far to this land, but it seems to be that only our King knows the answer.

"Duskuksa","Rune Sage Apprentice","A man of tradition and faith. This Rune Sage Apprentice intended to carry his forebears' legacy to the utmost.

"Nayedien","Kingâ€™s Aide","An elf of peerless beauty and ambiguity. No one knows where this elf is from or any past-of-self. For reasons unknown, the King saw fit to assign this person of unknown origin a hero of Royal Ordains and close aide. Court rumour that the King was charmed by such beauty, their dubious relationship, and the implication of elvish intervention aside, no one can verily deny the mastery in martial prowess of this elven warrior.","Special"
