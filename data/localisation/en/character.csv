"Vraesier1","Vagrant Marauder","This bandit has one thing really going, and that is her skill in weapons of most varieties.

"Iri1","Traveller","No one really understands why this hearty halfling travelled so far to this land, but it seems to be that only our King knows the answer. Her skill in trap and gadget engineering is closer to none, gathered during her vast journey, no doubt. A good of character, possibly the most friendly in the Royal Ordains.
