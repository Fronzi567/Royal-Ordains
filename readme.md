# How to run/compile

If you want to download the release version to test the game, go
to [Release](https://github.com/remance/Royal-Ordains/releases) tags and [**
download**](https://github.com/remance/Royal-Ordains/releases/download/0.1/royal-ordains.rar) the zip file. <br>

## Run

To start testing the game run `main.py` via Python interpreter for the source code or `main` file directly for the
release version. <br>

## System Requirements

### MINIMUM:

Something that can run pygame should be able to run this game.

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (OS: Windows 7 &#40;Haven't tested on Windows XP or Vista but may work&#41;, Ubuntu and macOS need further testing)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Memory: 2GB RAM)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Processor: Need more testing)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Graphics: Need more testing)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Graphics: Need more testing)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Storage: 1GB available space)

## Compile

To compile the source code into an executable program, recommend using pyinstaller and `main.spec`. <br>

Check the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file for dependency requirements if running with the python source
code.<br>

Also, the game is currently optimised based on the pygame 2.5.1 module and python 3.11.

## Tools

### Animation maker

Animation maker for the Vector-based character animation in game. The tool is made with pygame and the code is compatible enough for other purposes with some modification.
